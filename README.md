# Disneyland Project

Welcome to the Disneyland project! 

Disneyland Park is a magical place where both kids and those young at heart see their dreams come true. It's a mix of the past, present, and future, with nostalgic scenes like smiling train conductors and horse-drawn carriages, alongside thrilling adventures like rocketing through the galaxy or riding a runaway train. Laughter fills the air, and the charm lies in Disneyland's ability to evolve while keeping its timeless essence. As Walt Disney put it, "Disneyland will never be completed. It will keep growing as long as there's imagination in the world."

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Disneyland reviews. The dataset includes 42,000 reviews of 3 Disneyland branches - Paris, California and Hong Kong, posted by visitors on Trip Advisor.

Column Description:

ID: unique id given to each review

Rating: ranging from 1 (unsatisfied) to 5 (satisfied)

Year_Month: when the reviewer visited the theme park

Reviewer_Location: country of origin of visitor

Review_Text: comments made by visitor

The aim is to gain insights into the overall sentiment expressed by visitors in their reviews, helping us understand the public perception and satisfaction levels across these Disneyland parks.
